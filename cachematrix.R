## Create an inverse matrix by creating a cache matrix
## Returns the inverse of the matrix given

## Creates a matrix from the input to further be used

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        
        

}


## Actually inverts the cache matrix for returning the intended

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
