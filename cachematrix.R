## Cache an inverse of the matrix for many purposes
## Creates a cache matrix & and stores the inverse of a matrix into it

## Creates a cache matrix to be inverted

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Returns the inverse matrix of the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
